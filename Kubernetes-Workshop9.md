# 9. AKS access to Azure Database for MySQL via VNet

In this article, I will explain how to create the VNet environment between Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) and Azure Database for MySQL like follows.  
If you creted the following environment, you can only access to the MySQL via secure network environment not public network.

## 9.1 Create Resource Group for AKS with VNet Support

At first, you create a new Resource Group in the Azure. You will create both VNet and AKS in the Resource Group.

In this time, I will crete new Resource Group as ***MS-AKS_JPN*** as follows.

```
$ az group create --name MC-AKS-JPN --location japaneast

##### Following is the sample result of the above command.
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MC-AKS-JPN",
  "location": "japaneast",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "MC-AKS-JPN",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null
}
```

Then you create the new Azure VNet as ***AKS-VNET*** in the Resource Group as follows. For the VNet we configured the address range of "10.1.0.0/16".

```
$ az network vnet create -g MC-AKS-JPN \
    --name AKS-VNET \
    --address-prefixes 10.1.0.0/16 \ÃŸ
    -l japaneast

##### Following is the sample result of the above command.
{
  "newVNet": {
    "addressSpace": {
      "addressPrefixes": [
        "10.1.0.0/16"
      ]
    },
    "ddosProtectionPlan": null,
    "dhcpOptions": {
      "dnsServers": []
    },
    "enableDdosProtection": false,
    "enableVmProtection": false,
    "etag": "W/\"e3eb15fb-****-****-****-22e982650529\"",
    "id": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MC-AKS-JPN/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/AKS-VNET",
    "location": "japaneast",
    "name": "AKS-VNET",
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "resourceGroup": "MC-AKS-JPN",
    "resourceGuid": "8358fee4-****-****-****-05b35450436c",
    "subnets": [],
    "tags": {},
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks",
    "virtualNetworkPeerings": []
  }
}
```

After you created the new Azure VNet, please create SubNet as ***AKS-Subnet*** in the VNet? We specified the address range for the Subnet as "10.1.0.0/24". And also we specified the  services in the "--service-endpoints" which allowed private access to this subnet. In this time, Mycrosoft.SQL is available to access to this SubNet.

```
$ az network vnet subnet create \
    -g MC-AKS-JPN \
    -n AKS-Subnet \
    --vnet-name AKS-VNET \
    --address-prefix 10.1.0.0/24 \
    --service-endpoints Microsoft.SQL
    
##### Following is the sample result of the above command.
{
  "addressPrefix": "10.1.0.0/24",
  "etag": "W/\"bdde7c69-****-****-****-041a057f6be1\"",
  "id": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MC-AKS-JPN/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/AKS-VNET/subnets/AKS-Subnet",
  "ipConfigurations": null,
  "name": "AKS-Subnet",
  "networkSecurityGroup": null,
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "resourceGroup": "MC-AKS-JPN",
  "resourceNavigationLinks": null,
  "routeTable": null,
  "serviceEndpoints": [
    {
      "locations": [
        "japaneast"
      ],
      "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
      "service": "Microsoft.Sql"
    }
  ]
}
```

After you executed the above command, please copy & paste the SubNet id? Following SubNet ID is important, and you will use it int the following section.

*  ***"id": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-++++-++++-++++-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MC-AKS-JPN/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/AKS-VNET/subnets/AKS-Subnet"***


After you created both VNet and SubNet, you can confirm the configured information on the Azure Portal as follows.

![015](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1782/29215626348_a678d01cb0_c.jpg)

In the VNet(AKS-VNET), you can see the Subnet(AKS-Subnet) and "Microsft.SQL" service is available.

![018](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1790/28218834447_fe2448cbdc_c.jpg)


## 9.2 Install AKS with VNet Support

***I COULDN'T execute the above command in this time.*** 

```
$ az aks create -g "MC-AKS-JPN" --name "yoshio-jpneast-aks" \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --network-plugin "azure" \
    --vnet-subnet-id "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MC-AKS-JPN/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/AKS-VNET/subnets/AKS-Subnet" \
    --kubernetes-version 1.10.3 \
    --node-count 5 \
    --dns-name-prefix yoshio3-aks
```

In the future, we may be able to execute the above command. 
In stead of the above command, we will create the AKS Cluster by using Azure Portal GUI screen. 

At first, please goto the same Resource Group as the above VNet Resourece Group(MC-AKS-JPN)? Then you can see the following screen.

![001a](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1806/41276573920_0106aab4ab_c.jpg)

```
$ az aks get-credentials --resource-group MC-AKS-JPN --name yoshio-aks 
Merged "yoshio-aks" as current context in /Users/yoterada/.kube/config

```

## 9.3 Create Resoruce Group for MySQL with VNet Support

After you installed the AKS which available the VNet. you can acess to the Azure Managed Database like SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL from AKS. In this time, we access to the managed MySQL.

For MySQL VNet configuration, there already was very useful document as [Create and manage Azure Database for MySQL VNet service endpoints using Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/sl-si/azure/mysql/howto-manage-vnet-using-cli).

Based on the above document, I created MySQL with VNet service endpoint as follow.  

At first, please add the Extension for VNet support for DB as follows. After you added it, you can confirm the "az extension list" command.

```
$ az extension add --name rdbms-vnet
$ az extension list

##### Following is the sample result of the above command.
[
  {
    "extensionType": "whl",
    "name": "rdbms-vnet",
    "version": "10.0.0"
  }
]
```

Then, please create new Resource Group for installing the MySQL.

```
$ az group create --name MySQL-RG --location japaneast 

##### Following is the sample result of the above command.
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MySQL-RG",
  "location": "japaneast",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "MySQL-RG",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null
}
```

After created the Resource Group, please install MySQL Server like follows.

```
$ az mysql server create \
     --name my-mysqlserver \
     --resource-group MySQL-RG \
     --location japaneast \
     --admin-user myloginuser \
     --admin-password PASSWORD \
     --sku-name GP_Gen4_2

##### Following is the sample result of the above command.
{
  "administratorLogin": "yoterada",
  "earliestRestoreDate": "2018-06-29T12:21:50.183000+00:00",
  "fullyQualifiedDomainName": "my-mysqlserver.mysql.database.azure.com",
  "id": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MySQL-RG/providers/Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/my-mysqlserver",
  "location": "japaneast",
  "name": "my-mysqlserver",
  "resourceGroup": "MySQL-RG",
  "sku": {
    "capacity": 2,
    "family": "Gen4",
    "name": "GP_Gen4_2",
    "size": null,
    "tier": "GeneralPurpose"
  },
  "sslEnforcement": "Enabled",
  "storageProfile": {
    "backupRetentionDays": 7,

  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers",
  "userVisibleState": "Ready",
  "version": "5.7"
}
$ 
```

## 9.4 Add Security Rule for AKS to MySQL

In order to access to the MySQL from private VNet, please create the "vnet-rule" as follows. In the command ***please specify the "--subnet" argument*** which you got the SubNet ID in the above section like follow.

*  ***"id": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-++++-++++-++++-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MC-AKS-JPN/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/AKS-VNET/subnets/AKS-Subnet"***

```
$ az mysql server vnet-rule create  \
  -n k8sRule   \
  -g MySQL-RG  \
  -s my-mysqlserver \
  --subnet /subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MC-AKS-JPN/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/AKS-VNET/subnets/AKS-Subnet 

##### Following is the sample result of the above command.
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MySQL-RG/providers/Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/my-mysqlserver/virtualNetworkRules/k8sRule",
  "ignoreMissingVnetServiceEndpoint": false,
  "name": "k8sRule",
  "resourceGroup": "MySQL-RG",
  "state": "Ready",
  "type": "Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/virtualNetworkRules",
  "virtualNetworkSubnetId": "/subscriptions/f77aafe8-****-****-****-d0c37687ef70/resourceGroups/MC-AKS-JPN/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/AKS-VNET/subnets/AKS-Subnet"
}
$
```

After you executed the above command, you can see the following configuration in the Azure Portal.

![015](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1808/28218832987_02997c3499_c.jpg)

## 9.5 Access to MySQL from k8s POD (Evaluation)

Now, you configured all to connect to MySQL from the AKS by using private VNet. So please evaluate whether your can connect to the MySQL Server or not by following step?  

1. Create Ubuntu POD in AKS(k8s)
2. Login to the POD in AKS
3. Install MySQL Client Command
4. Connect to MySQL Server from MySQL Client



### 9.5.1 Create Ubuntu POD in AKS(k8s)

At first please create the Deployment YAML file? It will run the Ubuntu on k8s.
